Airbnb

The purpose of analyzing Airbnb data is to gain insights into the behavior of guests and hosts, as well as identify patterns and trends in the data that can be used to make better business decisions. By analyzing factors such as location, price, amenities, and ratings, data mining can help Airbnb understand what drives demand for certain properties, what features guests value most, and what the next steps for Airbnb should be.
